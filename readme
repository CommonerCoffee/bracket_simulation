Takes in a H2H matrix and does the following
- Convert H2H records to probabilities
- Randomizes a single elimination bracket N times
- Records the simulated placings of each player in the bracket
- Returns average placings for players as an attempt to rank

Potential issues and future considerations 
- Bayesian approach with priors to soften probabilities
- Unplayed player pairs currently cause a discarded bracket but this seems to introduce unclear bias
- Only takes into account H2H, assumes a metagame that only consists of these players
